Assignment for AccuKnox Product Management Trainee role.

Candidate Name: Navjot Kaur

Topic: Alert Triage Workflow – showing how a security engineer investigates and resolves a cloud security alert.

Reason: I chose this option because it allows me to focus on understanding the security engineer’s workflow and how they interact with the product. This option highlights user behavior and expectations by focusing on reducing complexity in alert handling, allowing security engineers to respond more effectively during critical situations.

Problem Statement: Security engineers often struggle to prioritize security alerts due to a high volume of low-importance or non-actionable alerts. This overload delays the response to critical alerts, creates stress and operational chaos, and ultimately leads to poor or delayed decision-making during critical security incidents.

USER PERSONA:
Role: Security Engineer
Environment: Cloud Security
Responsibilities: Monitor and investigate security alerts to protect cloud systems.

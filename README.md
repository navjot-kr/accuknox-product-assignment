# accuknox-product-assignment

Assignment for AccuKnox Product Management Trainee role.

Candidate Name: Navjot Kaur

Topic: Alert Triage Workflow – showing how a security engineer investigates and resolves a cloud security alert.

Reason: I chose this option because it allows me to focus on understanding the security engineer’s workflow and how they interact with the product. This option highlights user behavior and expectations by focusing on reducing complexity in alert handling, allowing security engineers to respond more effectively during critical situations.

Problem Statement: Security engineers often struggle to prioritize security alerts due to a high volume of low-importance or non-actionable alerts. This overload delays the response to critical alerts, creates stress and operational chaos, and ultimately leads to poor or delayed decision-making during critical security incidents.

User Persona:

Role: Security Engineer

Environment: Cloud Security

Responsibilities: Monitor and investigate security alerts to protect cloud systems.

Goals: Quickly identify and act on critical or actionable alerts.

Pain Points: Overwhelmed by a high volume of non-actionable or low-importance alerts, making prioritization difficult, causing delays, increasing stress, and leading to poor decision-making during critical situations.

Wireframes using figma -

The following wireframes illustrate the alert triage experience for a security engineer, focusing on prioritisation, assignment, and situational awareness.

Screen 1 : Alert Overview

This screen gives users a quick view of all alerts in one place.
Alerts are grouped by assignment status — assigned to me, assigned to others, and unassigned — so users can easily see what needs attention.
Basic details like alert ID, severity, and status help users decide where to focus first.

Screen 2 : Assigned Alerts

This screen shows alerts that are assigned to the current user.
Users can view alert details, set priority, and co-assign alerts if help is needed.
Unassigned alerts are visible on the side, making it easy to pick up new work without leaving the screen.
